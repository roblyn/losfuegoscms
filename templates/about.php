					<h3>About</h3>

						<p>
							Los Fuegos are a multicultural band located in Kolding, Denmark. Their music gravitates towards a multicultural concept that displays elements from their own culture and musical background. 
						 
						Their original material emphasizes on problematics that reflect our reality and condition as immigrants in a foreign country. They flow within different dynamics and various styles; the wild ecstatic energy of balkan music, the raw instinctive feeling of cumbia, the waving flow of reggae and the aggressive phrasing of rock. 
						 
						Their music is an invitation to explore different creative nuances, to think out of the box, to get out of the comfort zone and to speak the language we all have in common in a world with no borders and no language barriers. They represent a different approach to living and interacting in the globalized world.
						 
						Their ultimate goals are to open our audiences towards foreign forms of art and to achieve local and international recognition.
						 
						Stop thinking mainstream and start thinking Fuego!!!</p>
